# @reworkjs/cli

The [ReworkJS](https://github.com/reworkjs/reworkjs) command line interface.  
Install this globally to gain access to the `rjs` command from anywhere on your system.

`npm install -g @reworkjs/cli`

This package is little more than a wrapper around the local cli provided by `@reworkjs/reworkjs`, as well as a `rjs init` command.  
Therefore, there is no need to install it locally. Always install it globally or not at all.

## Commands

Please refer to [The ReworkJS CLI documentation](https://github.com/reworkjs/reworkjs/blob/develop/docs/cli.md) for 
the list of available commands, or run `rjs --help`.
